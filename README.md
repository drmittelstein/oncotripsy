# Oncotripsy - Keller-Miksis Cavitation Simulation

This repository includes scripts that were used to simulate the impact of cavitating bubbles in amplifying incident ultrasound waves on nearby cells.  

### Software Prerequisites

This system requires baseline MATLAB, it was programmed on 2019, but may run on earlier versions.

## How to Use

This repo uses the Keller-Miksis model to simulate the pressure amplification of an incident ultrasound signal as a function of initial bubble radius and distance from center of cavitating bubble.  The following figure is generated which shows decibel gain in the incident ultrasound frequency FFT of the pressure emissions from cavitating bubbles compared to the stimulating ultrasound signal.  Initial bubble radius on the y-axis and distance from the bubble on the x-axis.  In red regions the cavitating bubbleâ€™s emitted pressure has a larger FFT signal at the stimulation frequency than the ultrasound signal.

Generating this image requires two steps: 1) Running Keller-Miksis simulation for all bubble radii, 2) Taking FFT of all bubble radius vs time datasets genreated

### Running Keller Miksis Simulation

Use this function, with modified parameters to represent the simulation desired, to generate the Keller-Miksis radius vs time datasets

```
KellerMiksis_batch.m
```

For testing purposes, a single Keller-Miksis simulation can be done using:

```
KellerMiksis_single.m
```

### Running FFT and getting Far Field Pressure

After the previous step, run this function, with modified parameters to represent the simulation desired, to generate the output figure

```
FarFieldPressure.m
```

### Natural Frequency of Bubble

For a graph of the natural frequency of bubbles as a function of initial radius, run the following function:

```
NatFreq.m
```
