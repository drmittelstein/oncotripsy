# Oncotripsy

This repository includes scripts that were used to simulate the impact of cavitating bubbles in amplifying incident ultrasound waves on nearby cells.  

### Software Prerequisites

This system requires baseline MATLAB, it was programmed on 2019, but may run on earlier versions.

## How to Use

This repo uses the Keller-Miksis model to simulate the pressure amplification of an incident ultrasound signal as a function of initial bubble radius and distance from center of cavitating bubble leading to the generation of the following image:
