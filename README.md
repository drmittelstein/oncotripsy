This repository includes scripts that were used to simulate the impact of cavitating bubbles in amplifying incident ultrasound waves on nearby cells.  

### Software Prerequisites

This system requires baseline MATLAB, it was programmed on 2019, but may run on earlier versions.

## How to Use

This repo uses the Keller-Miksis model to simulate the pressure amplification of an incident ultrasound signal as a function of initial bubble radius and distance from center of cavitating bubble leading to the generation of the following image:

![Output image](/images/FarField_FFT.png)

Generating this image requires two steps: 1) Running Keller-Miksis simulation for all bubble radii, 2) Taking FFT of all bubble radius vs time datasets genreated

### Running Keller Miksis Simulation

Use this function, with modified parameters to represent the simulation desired, to generate the Keller-Miksis radius vs time datasets

```
KellerMiksis_batch.m
```

For testing purposes, a single Keller-Miksis simulation can be done using:

```
KellerMiksis_single.m
```

### Running FFT and getting Far Field Pressure

After the previous step, run this function, with modified parameters to represent the simulation desired, to generate the output figure

```
FarFieldPressure.m
```

### Natural Frequency of Bubble

For a graph of the natural frequency of bubbles as a function of initial radius, run the following function:

```
NatFreq.m
```
